# Q-Puzzle

## Description
Q-Puzzle is a Windows Forms platform game that allows the player to design, save, load and play custom levels.

## Rules
Any game level contains at most 4 doors of different colors and several balls matching the color of one of the doors. For each ball there must be at least one door of the same color. The user selects one of the balls and moves it Up, Down, Left, or Right using the control pad. The selected ball will move until it collides with a wall, a door, or another ball. If the door it collided with has the same color, the ball is removed. The goal of the game is to get rid of all balls in the level.
